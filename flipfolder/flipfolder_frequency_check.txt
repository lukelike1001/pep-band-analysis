(Not-so) Frequently Asked Questions:
In case you're curious about my methodology for counting entries.

Q: There are two "Shorts - Spell/Shook" entries in FlipFolder. Did you count these duplicates in your count?

A: As of 04/27/2024 (MM/DD/YYYY), no.



Q: But what about "The Whip" (entry)? It includes both "Dear Old Duke (revised 1999)" and "The Whip" (song).

A: I don't count this entry as two songs since the "Dear Old Duke (revised 1999)" featured in the "The Whip" (entry) and "Dear Old Duke" (entry) are basically identical.

When a song can't be found anywhere else except one entry, then I'll include it to this list.
